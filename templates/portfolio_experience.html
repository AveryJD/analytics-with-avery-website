          <h2>Lifeguard - Municipality of the District of Guysborough</h2>
          <p>
            I worked as a pool lifeguard each summer during the months of June to August from 2020 to 2024 (1 year total). For the first two 
            summers, I served as a junior lifeguard, earning certifications in First Aid, Bronze Medallion, and Bronze Cross. In my third 
            summer, I became a national lifeguard and swim instructor, earning my National Lifeguard and Swim Instructor 
            certifications. In my final summer I took on the responsibility of co-headguard, and continued teaching as a swim instuctor.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a lifeguard, I ensured the safety of all pool users and responded to emergencies. As a swim instructor, I taught children from ages
            3 to 15 water safety and swimming techniques, and helped prepare young teens for future lifeguard certifications. This job strengthened 
            my leadership, teamwork, and decision-making skills while emphasizing responsibility and clear communication.

          <h2>Retail Associate - Your Independent Grocer</h2>
          <p>
            I worked as a retail associate from August 2019 to May 2023 (3 years, 4 months total), taking some time off occasionally for school 
            and summer employment as a lifeguard. My responsibilities included operating as a cashier, stocking shelves, unloading shipments, 
            managing the produce section, and assisting with store closing procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            This role enhanced my customer service and communication abilities, taught me how to multitask in a busy environment, and sharpened 
            my attention to detail by ensuring accurate inventory and product presentation.
