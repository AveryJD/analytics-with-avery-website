        <p>
          My name is Avery Doiron and I'm a student atending St. Francis Xavier University in my home province of Nova Scotia, Canada. 
          I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I have a strong 
          interest in data science, particularly how it can be used to uncover insights, drive decisions, and tell compelling stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm very passionate about sports, both playing and watching them, with my favourite being hockey. My love for both sports and computer 
          science has led me to explore the use of data science and analytics in sports. I enjoy digging into player stats, trends, and patterns to better 
          understand the game and find creative ways to visualize performance data.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to work in the analytics department of a professional sports team, where I can combine my technical skills 
          with my love for the game. Whether it's through research, custom-built data tools, or visual storytelling, I'm driven to make an 
          impact in the sports analytics community.
